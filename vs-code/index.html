            <p>Technically we could write all of our code in Terminal - but wouldn't it be nice to have a pretty interface with helpful tools?</p>
            <p>Writing code in Terminal is like writing a book in the old Notepad application that came with computers. VS Code is like Word - many more features.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> VS Code is an IDE - Integrated Development Enviornment. All the things developers need to do - write code, debug, project management is all included. </p>
