            <h1>THE FINAL LEVEL</h1>
            <p>Follow the steps below to add a local file to your GitHub repository and push it to your remote repository.</p>
        </header>

        <section id="step-1">
            <h2>Step 1: Scratch File into Local Repo</h2>
            <p>Using the commands we have learned in class, move your Scratch file (ends in .sb3) into the repository you cloned onto your computer.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="step-2">
            <h2>Step 2: Add Your File to the Repository</h2>
            <p>Even though your file is in the repo's directory, Git does not yet KNOW about your file. </p>
            <p>Add your file to Git's tracking by running: </p>
            <pre><code>git add &lt;your-scratch-project.sb3&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>This stages your file to be committed.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="step-3">
            <h2>Step 3: Commit the Changes</h2>
            <p>Now that your file is staged, you need to commit it. A commit is like a snapshot of your changes. Run the following command:</p>
            <pre><code>git commit -m "Added scratch project to repo"</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="step-4">
            <h2>Step 4: Push Your Changes to GitHub</h2>
            <p>Once you've committed your changes, push them to your remote GitHub repository using the following command:</p>
            <pre><code>git push main</code></pre>
            <p></p>
            <p>Explanation:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>git push</strong> - pushes your committed changes to the remote repository.</li>
                    <!-- <li><strong>origin</strong> - the default name for your remote GitHub repository.</li> -->
                    <li><strong>main</strong> - the name of the branch you're pushing to (if you're using GitHub's default branch, it's often called <code>main</code> depending on the setup).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>After running this command, your local file will be uploaded to your GitHub repository.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="step-5">
            <h2>Step 5: Verify Your Changes on GitHub.com</h2>
            <p>Now, head over to your GitHub repository page and refresh it. You should see the file you just added in the repository.</p>
            <p>If everything went smoothly, congratulations! You've successfully added a local file to your GitHub repository and pushed it to the remote.</p>
            <p>This is how you will submit coding assignments from now on!</p>
